# KMeans_clustering_mall_customers
This project implements KMeans clustering on mall customer data to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviors and other attributes. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can help the mall in targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and overall business strategy.

Dataset
The dataset includes customer data with attributes like:
1.Annual Income
2.Spending Score

Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/KMeans_Clustering_Mall_Customers.git
cd KMeans_Clustering_Mall_Customers
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the Python script to apply KMeans clustering:
python src/kmeans_clustering.py

Or use the Jupyter notebook for a step-by-step approach:
jupyter notebook notebooks/KMeans_Clustering_Mall.ipynb

Results
The project segments customers into clusters, helping identify customer groups like high-income, low-spending or low-income, high-spending.
